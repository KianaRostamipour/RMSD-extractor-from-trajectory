This code reads RMSD values from a trajectory analysis file and generates a bash script (generate_structures.sh). The generated bash script is used to extract PDB structures from trajectory files at specific time points corresponding to RMSD quartiles.
Replace 'PDB ID' with the appropriate protein name as needed.
